# First 2D Game

Here you can see my first ever Unity 2D project in the form of a 2D platformer-fighting game in which the player character is a druid overcome by a mysterious plague.

The game features varied enemies, simple enemy AI, spells for the player, short and simple puzzles involving finding keys, static traps and even a simple final bossfight.

This game was made several years prior to this readme (in 2020) and publicized only now.


Some art and videos from the game itself:
